# Step-by-Step Implementation Guide for Elastic Stack SIEM

This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to implementing the Elastic Stack SIEM solution. It is designed to help you understand what you're doing at each stage of the implementation process.

## Phase 1: Preparation and Setup

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Docker Desktop for M1 Mac**:
   - Download Docker Desktop from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   - Install and configure with at least 4GB of RAM allocation
   - Verify installation by running: `docker --version` and `docker-compose --version`

2. **Create Project Directory Structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p elastic-stack-siem/{architecture,docker,data-pipeline,visualization,scenarios,documentation,presentation}
   cd elastic-stack-siem
   ```

3. **Initialize Git Repository** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   git init
   echo "# Elastic Stack SIEM Implementation" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

### Step 2: Understand the Architecture

1. **Review the Architecture Documentation**:
   - Open and read `architecture/elastic_stack_architecture.md`
   - Study the component relationships diagram
   - Understand the network architecture diagram

2. **Familiarize Yourself with Components**:
   - Elasticsearch: Data storage and search engine
   - Kibana: Visualization and user interface
   - Logstash: Data processing pipeline
   - Beats: Data collection agents
   - Elastic Security: SIEM functionality

## Phase 2: Docker Deployment

### Step 3: Configure Docker Environment

1. **Navigate to Docker Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd docker
   ```

2. **Review Docker Compose File**:
   - Open and understand `docker-compose.yml`
   - Note the services, networks, and volumes defined

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the sample .env file: `cp .env.sample .env` (if using the sample)
   - Edit the .env file: `nano .env`
   - Set a strong `ELASTIC_PASSWORD`
   - Set a random `KIBANA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32+ characters)
   - Adjust memory settings if needed

### Step 4: Deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana

1. **Start Elasticsearch**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d elasticsearch
   ```

2. **Monitor Elasticsearch Startup**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f elasticsearch
   ```
   - Wait until you see logs indicating Elasticsearch is running
   - Look for: "started" and "ready" messages

3. **Start Kibana**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d kibana
   ```

4. **Monitor Kibana Startup**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f kibana
   ```
   - Wait until you see logs indicating Kibana is running
   - Look for: "Server running at" message

5. **Verify Access to Kibana**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5601`
   - Log in with:
     - Username: `elastic`
     - Password: The value you set for `ELASTIC_PASSWORD` in the .env file

### Step 5: Deploy Logstash and Beats

1. **Start Logstash**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d logstash
   ```

2. **Monitor Logstash Startup**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f logstash
   ```
   - Wait until you see logs indicating Logstash is running
   - Look for: "Pipeline started successfully" message

3. **Start Beats Components**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d filebeat packetbeat auditbeat
   ```

4. **Monitor Beats Startup**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f filebeat
   docker-compose logs -f packetbeat
   docker-compose logs -f auditbeat
   ```
   - Verify each Beat is running correctly

5. **Verify Data Collection**:
   - In Kibana, navigate to Management > Stack Management > Index Management
   - Verify that indices are being created for each Beat:
     - `filebeat-*`
     - `packetbeat-*`
     - `auditbeat-*`

## Phase 3: Data Pipeline Configuration

### Step 6: Configure Logstash Pipelines

1. **Review Logstash Pipeline Configurations**:
   - Examine the pipeline configurations in `docker/logstash/pipeline/`
   - Understand the input, filter, and output sections

2. **Customize Pipelines if Needed**:
   - Modify the pipeline configurations to match your specific requirements
   - Add additional pipelines for specific data sources if needed

3. **Restart Logstash to Apply Changes**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart logstash
   ```

4. **Verify Pipeline Operation**:
   - Check Logstash logs: `docker-compose logs -f logstash`
   - Look for successful pipeline initialization and data processing

### Step 7: Configure Beats for Data Collection

1. **Review Beat Configurations**:
   - Examine the configuration files in their respective directories:
     - `docker/filebeat/filebeat.yml`
     - `docker/packetbeat/packetbeat.yml`
     - `docker/auditbeat/auditbeat.yml`

2. **Customize Beat Configurations if Needed**:
   - Modify the configurations to match your specific requirements
   - Add additional data sources or modules as needed

3. **Restart Beats to Apply Changes**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart filebeat packetbeat auditbeat
   ```

4. **Verify Data Collection**:
   - In Kibana, navigate to Discover
   - Create index patterns for each Beat if they don't exist
   - Verify that data is being collected and indexed

### Step 8: Generate Sample Data (Optional)

1. **Navigate to Data Pipeline Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../data-pipeline
   ```

2. **Run Sample Data Generation Script**:
   ```bash
   python3 generate_sample_data.py
   ```

3. **Verify Sample Data**:
   - Check the generated files in `sample_data/` directory
   - Review the data structure and content

## Phase 4: Visualization and Dashboard Setup

### Step 9: Import Visualization Templates

Remember that this is a starting point. As you become more familiar with the system, you can expand its capabilities by:
- Adding more data sources
- Creating custom detection rules
- Developing specialized dashboards
- Integrating with other security tools
