## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

- M1 Mac with Docker Desktop installed
- At least 4GB of RAM allocated to Docker
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Basic understanding of Docker and containerization
- Terminal access

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>/elastic-stack-siem
```

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Navigate to the docker directory:
   ```bash
   cd docker
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file to customize your deployment:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

3. At minimum, change the following variables:
   - `ELASTIC_PASSWORD`: Set a strong password for the Elasticsearch admin user
   - `KIBANA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Set a random 32+ character string for Kibana encryption
   - Adjust memory settings if needed based on your system resources

#### 3. Deploy the Elastic Stack

1. Start the Elastic Stack using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d elasticsearch kibana
   ```

2. Wait for Elasticsearch and Kibana to fully initialize (this may take a few minutes):
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f elasticsearch kibana
   ```
   
   Wait until you see logs indicating that both services are running properly.

3. Once Elasticsearch and Kibana are running, deploy Logstash:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d logstash
   ```

4. Finally, deploy the Beats components:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d filebeat packetbeat auditbeat
   ```

#### 4. Access Kibana

1. Open a web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5601
   ```

2. Log in with the following credentials:
   - Username: `elastic`
   - Password: The value you set for `ELASTIC_PASSWORD` in the `.env` file

For detailed deployment instructions, refer to the [Deployment Guide](./docker/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Data Pipeline Configuration

### Data Sources

The Elastic Stack SIEM solution collects data from various sources:

1. **System Logs**:
   - Authentication logs (SSH, sudo, etc.)
   - System logs (kernel, services, etc.)
   - Application logs (web servers, databases, etc.)

2. **Network Data**:
   - Network traffic (packets, flows, etc.)
   - Firewall logs
   - DNS queries and responses
   - HTTP/HTTPS traffic

3. **Security-Specific Data**:
   - Endpoint security events
   - Intrusion detection/prevention system alerts
   - Vulnerability scan results
   - Threat intelligence feeds

4. **Windows-Specific Data**:
   - Windows Event Logs
   - Sysmon events
   - PowerShell logs
   - WMI activity logs

### Data Ingestion Methods

The Elastic Stack SIEM solution uses various methods to ingest data:

1. **Beats Agents**:
   - Filebeat for log files
   - Packetbeat for network traffic
   - Auditbeat for system audit data
   - Winlogbeat for Windows event logs

2. **Logstash**:
   - Central data processing pipeline
   - Data enrichment and transformation
   - Output to Elasticsearch

### Logstash Pipeline Configuration

Logstash pipelines are configured to process and enrich data before indexing in Elasticsearch. Key pipeline configurations include:

1. **Authentication Events Pipeline**:
   - Processes authentication logs
   - Extracts user, source IP, and authentication status
   - Adds GeoIP information for source IPs

2. **Network Traffic Pipeline**:
   - Processes network traffic data
   - Identifies potential web attacks
   - Detects suspicious DNS activity

3. **Windows Events Pipeline**:
   - Processes Windows security events
   - Identifies suspicious PowerShell commands
   - Tracks user and group changes

For detailed data pipeline configuration, refer to the [Data Pipeline and Visualization Documentation](./data-pipeline/data_pipeline_and_visualization.md).
