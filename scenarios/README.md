# Security Scenarios for Elastic Stack SIEM

This directory contains detailed documentation for implementing and testing security scenarios with the Elastic Stack SIEM solution. These scenarios are designed to demonstrate the detection capabilities of the SIEM implementation and provide realistic examples for security monitoring and incident response.

## Included Scenarios

1. [Brute Force Attack Detection](./brute_force_attack.md)
2. [Malware/Suspicious File Detection](./malware_detection.md)
3. [Data Exfiltration Detection](./data_exfiltration.md)

## Purpose

These scenarios serve multiple purposes:
- Validate the functionality of the Elastic Stack SIEM implementation
- Demonstrate detection capabilities to stakeholders
- Provide training materials for security analysts
- Establish a baseline for future security monitoring enhancements

## Implementation Approach

Each scenario includes:
- Real-world context and attack overview
- Environment setup requirements
- Step-by-step attack execution instructions
- Expected detection outcomes
- Validation methods
- Remediation recommendations

## Usage Instructions

1. Review the scenario documentation to understand the attack and detection mechanisms
2. Set up the required environment as specified in each scenario
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to execute the attack
4. Observe the detection in the Elastic Stack SIEM
5. Validate the results against the expected outcomes
6. Document any discrepancies or improvements

## Prerequisites

Before implementing these scenarios, ensure you have:
- A functioning Elastic Stack SIEM deployment (see [Deployment Guide](../docker/DEPLOYMENT.md))
- Configured data pipelines and visualizations (see [Data Pipeline Documentation](../data-pipeline/data_pipeline_and_visualization.md))
- Appropriate test environments that won't impact production systems
